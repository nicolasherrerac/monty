# Monty Interpreter

This interpreter reads Monty bytecode files of any extension (preferably `.m` although it doesn't matter), and interprets the opcodes contained.

It was built in the C language and is compliant with `ISO90`, `ISO99`, & `ISO11`.

The interpreter can handle a variety of Monty opcodes, all handled opcodes are listed below.

## Monty Opcodes

* **push**
  * Usage: `push <int>`
  * Pushes an element to the stack and queue.
  * The parameter `<int>` must be an integer.

* **pall**
  * Prints all values in the stack and queue, starting from the top.

* **pint**
  * Prints the top value of the stack and queue.

* **pop**
  * Removes the top element of the stack and queue.

* **swap**
  * Swaps the top two elements of the stack and queue.

* **add**
  * Adds the top two elements of the stack.
  * The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is popped.

* **nop**
  * Does not do anything.

* **sub**
  * Subtracts the top element of the stack and queue from the second element from the top.
  * The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.

* **mul**
  * Multiplies the top two elements of the stack and queue.
  * The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.

* **div**
  * Divides the second element from the top of the stack and queue by the top element.
  * The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.

* **mod**
  * Computes the modulus of the second element from the top of the stack and queue divided by the top element.
  * The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.

* **pchar**
  * Prints the character value of the top element of the stack and queue.
  * The integer at the top is treated as an ASCII value.

* **pstr**
  * Prints the string contained in the stack and queue.
  * Prints characters element by element until the stack/queue is empty, a value is `0`, or an error occurs.

* **rotl**
  * Rotates the top element of the stack and queue to the bottom.

* **rotr**
  * Rotates the bottom element of the stack and queue to the top.

* **stack**
  * Switches a queue to stack mode.

* **queue**
  * Switches a stack to queue mode.

When the first non-space character of a line is #, treat this line as a comment (donâ€™t do anything).

Monty byte code files can contain blank lines (empty or made of spaces only, and any additional text after the opcode or its required argument is not taken into account).

## Examples

The opcode pop removes the top element of the stack.

```
$ cat example.m
push 1
push 2
push 3
pall
pop
pint
$ ./monty example.m
3
2
1
2
```

The opcode add adds the top two elements of the stack.

```
$ cat example.m 
push 1
push 2
push 3
pall
add
pall

$ ./monty example.m 
3
2
1
5
1
```


```
$ cat sub.m 
push 1
push 2
push 10
push 3
sub
pall
$ ./monty sub.m 
7
2
1
```
